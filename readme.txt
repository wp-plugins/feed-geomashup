Let two great plugins play great together. Use FeedWordPress to aggregate 
geodata generated by GeoMashup. 

== Description ==

The FeedGeoMashup plugin is a short and simple bit of code that lets the 
[FeedWordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedwordpress/) plugin 
pass GeoRSS data to the
[GeoMashup](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/geo-mashup/) plugin. There 
is nothing to edit or configure; simply activate the plugin and you will be able
to aggregate and reassemble Google Maps mashups from multiple sites.
FeedGeoMashup will do nothing unless you have installed, activated
 and configured FeedWordPress and GeoMashup. FeedGeoMashup will have no effect on feeds (or
items within feeds) that do not include any GeoRSS elements.

== Installation ==

You can search for this plugin from your WordPress plugins administration interface and install it automatically.

Or to install it manually:

1. Download the zipped plugin using the link to the right
1. Unzip it and put the folder in your wp-contents/plugins folder

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin pull in geodata from other sources? =

It might. It was created to operate on the GeoRSS generated by the GeoMashup
plugin, but it should work on other similarly formatted feeds. 

= Are you offering support for this plugin? =

No.

== Screenshots ==

The plugin operates entirely in the background, so there is no relevant
screenshot to share.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0 =
This is the initial release.

== Usage ==

You must have FeedWordPress and GeoMashup installed, activated, and configured
in order for Feed GeoMashup to do anything. Please see the independent
documentation for those plugins. 

Once you have those pieces in place, you can activate the plugin and start
pulling in Google Maps Mashups.
